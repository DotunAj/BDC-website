      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take
        it in the spirit in which it's intended — a guide to make it easier to
        be excellent to each other. We expect it to be followed in spirit as
        much as in the letter.

        <span>Be welcoming.</span>
        <br />
        We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all
        backgrounds and identities. This includes members of any race,
        ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social
        and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
        identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
        religion, and mental and physical ability.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Be respectful.</span>
        <br />
        People working together will inevitably disagree or become frustrated
        with one another at times, but conflict is no excuse for bad behavior or
        personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable or
        threatened is not a productive one. Be respectful of one another and
        those outside our community who interact with us.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Be collaborative</span>
        <br />
        What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of
        many dreams. Collaboration between subgroups that each have their own
        goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of
        its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.
        Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
        Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever
        possible, we work closely with others to coordinate our efforts.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Ask for help when unsure</span>
        <br />
        Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions
        early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though
        they may be directed to the appropriate person Those who are asked
        should be responsive and helpful.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Please do not Spam the group.</span>
        <br />
        Do not post adverts, or campaigns or sale of anything it should be
        strongly related to technology, you can use the random channel to post
        such.
